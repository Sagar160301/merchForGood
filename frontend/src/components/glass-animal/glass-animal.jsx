          "Many of the people I love most in the world have suffered from
          cancer. Physical problems aside, I have seen the psychological and
          social side effects surrounding it overwhelm them. If each t-shirt
          goes a little way towards helping someone find their footing, itâ€™s a
          huge win." Dave Bayley, Glass Animals{" "}
