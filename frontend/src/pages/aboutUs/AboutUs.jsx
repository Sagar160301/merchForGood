      <h3>YOUR MERCH FOR GOOD T-SHIRT CAN HELP CHANGE LIVES. </h3>
      <p>
        Merch for Good is a collection of exclusive t-shirts designed by some of
        the world's best artists & musicians. 100% profits from each sale
        directly supports young adults living with and beyond cancer. It's a
        unique fundraising initiative masterminded by the small team at
        Trekstock, the London based national charity dedicated to a future where
        anyone in their 20s or 30s who has heard the words "it's cancer" is
        given tailored support they need.

      <p>
        We couldn't do it without you and we want you to know that we're making
        every penny count.

      <p>
        <b> 34 young adults are diagnosed every day in the UK,</b> we are
        dedicated to providing them with the tools they need to get moving
        physically, socially and psychologically when cancer stops them in their
        tracks. We know our support is making a difference. We have a print on
        demand model, so we don't have to hold stock, meaning we keep our costs
        down and more of your donation gets channeled into our work, which we
        think it pretty awesome. We work with some of the world's best artists
        and musicians and we owe each and every one of them and their management
        teams, a big thank you for their support.
